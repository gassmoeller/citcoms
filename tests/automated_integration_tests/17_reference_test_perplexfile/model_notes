Test model that uses all features of the CMB1000 reference model but in a lower resolution and smaller number of tracers. Is intended to run in a few minutes on typical desktop computers and still do regression testing for all relevant features. This version is also testing the new reference state 4, which reads in the original perplex file. This is done to avoid the additional computation step in an external refstate program.
